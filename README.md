# Chart.js Experiments
Exploring features of, and building charts using Chart.js library. In order to compare it to proprietary solutions such as Tableau/Power BI.

# Before you get started
- HTML and basic Javascript knowledge

# Notes

### Advantages
- Good documentation, easy to get started
- Charts have animation functionality
- Chart appearance is highly configurable compared to BI solutions
- Free and open source
- Can be integrated into any website cost effectively
- Chart code can be reused extensively once built. Templates for styles or chart structure can be built once and used everywhere.

### Disadvantages
- No geographic visualizations functionality, most likely will need to use another javascript library to account for this drawback
- Filters need to be manually built and integrated whereas BI solutions have in-built filters.
- Datasource is limited to APIs

# Tests
- Creating line/bar/scatter charts
- Updating charts
- Feeding charts values from third party API
- Filtering charts by building custom javascript functions/filters in HTML
